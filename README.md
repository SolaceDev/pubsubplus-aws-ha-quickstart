# Install and Configure Solace PubSub+ Software Message Brokers in an HA Tuple using AWS Cloud Formation

![alt text](/images/Solace-AWS-HA-Prod-3AZ.png "Production Environment for Solace PubSub+ Software Message Brokers")

This Quick Start template installs Solace PubSub+ software message brokers in fault tolerant high-availability (HA) redundancy groups. HA redundancy provides 1:1 message broker redundancy to increase overall service availability. If one of the message brokers fails, or is taken out of service, the other one automatically takes over and provides service to the clients that were previously served by the now out-of-service message broker.  To increase availability, the message brokers are deployed across 3 availability zones.

To learn more about message broker redundancy see the [Redundancy Documentation](https://docs.solace.com/Features/SW-Broker-Redundancy-and-Fault-Tolerance.htm ).  If you are not familiar with Solace PubSub+ or high-availability configurations it is recommended that you review this document. 

![alt text](/images/Solace-AWS-HA-PoC-2AZ.png "Proof of Concept Environment for Solace PubSub+ Software Message Brokers")

Alternatively this Quick Start can create message brokers in an environment suitable for Proof-of-Concept testing where loss of an AWS Availability Zone will not cause loss of access to mission critical data.

To learn more about connectivity to the HA redundancy group see the AWS [VPC Gateway Documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html ).

# Minimum Resource Requirements

Below is the list of AWS resources that will be deployed by the Quick Start. Please consult the [Amazon VPC Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Appendix_Limits.html ) page and ensure that your AWS region is within the limit range per resource before launching:

| Resource                   | Deploy |
|----------------------------|--------|
| VPCs                       |   1    |
| subnets                    |   6    |
| Elastic IPs                |   5    |
| Internet Gateways          |   1    |
| NAT Gateways               |   3    |
| Running Instances          |   5    |
| Route Tables               |   5    |
| Network ACLs               |   1    |
| Endpoints                  |   1    |
| Security Groups            |   6    |

## Required IAM roles

Look for `AWS::IAM::Role` in the templates source for the list of required IAM roles to create the stacks.

# How to Deploy a Message Broker in an HA Group

This is a two step process:

**Step 1**: Obtain a reference to the Docker image of the Solace PubSub+ message broker to be deployed

First, decide which [Solace PubSub+ message broker](https://docs.solace.com/Solace-SW-Broker-Set-Up/Setting-Up-SW-Brokers.htm ) and version is suitable to your use case.

The Docker image reference can be:

*	A public or accessible private Docker registry repository name with an optional tag. This is the recommended option if using PubSub+ Standard. The default is to use the latest message broker image [available from Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/solace/solace-pubsub-standard/ ) as `solace/solace-pubsub-standard:latest`, or use a specific version [tag](https://hub.docker.com/r/solace/solace-pubsub-standard/tags/ ).

*	A Docker image download URL
     * If using Solace PubSub+ Enterprise Evaluation Edition, go to the Solace Downloads page. For the image reference, copy and use the download URL in the Solace PubSub+ Enterprise Evaluation Edition Docker Images section.

         | PubSub+ Enterprise Evaluation Edition<br/>Docker Image
         | :---: |
         | 90-day trial version of PubSub+ Enterprise |
         | [Get URL of Evaluation Docker Image](http://dev.solace.com/downloads#eval ) |

     * If you have purchased a Docker image of Solace PubSub+ Enterprise, Solace will give you information for how to download the compressed tar archive package from a secure Solace server. Contact Solace Support at support@solace.com if you require assistance. Then you can host this tar archive together with its MD5 on a file server and use the download URL as the image reference.

**Step 2**: Go to the AWS Cloud Formation service and launch the template. The following links are for your convenience and take you directly to the message broker templates.

**Note:** Using `Launch Quick Start (for new VPC)` launches the AWS infrastructure stacks needed with the message broker stack on top (recommended). However, if you have previously launched this Quick Start within your target region and would like to re-deploy just the message broker stack on top of the existing AWS infrastructure stacks, you can use `Launch Quick Start (for existing VPC)`.

<a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/new?stackName=Solace-HA&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/solace-products/solace-aws-ha-quickstart/latest/templates/solace-master.template" target="_blank">
    <img src="/images/launch-button-new.png"/>
</a>

<a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/new?stackName=Solace-HA&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/solace-products/solace-aws-ha-quickstart/latest/templates/solace.template" target="_blank">
    <img src="/images/launch-button-existing.png"/>
</a>

* If you want to take a look under the hood, you can view the AWS CloudFormation template that automates the deployment. You can customize the template during launch or download and extend it for other projects. For that, copy your extended version of `scripts`, `submodules` and `templates` directories in a  folder in an S3 bucket and make them public.

| VPC ID (VPCID)             | _Requires_ _input_ | Choose the ID of your existing VPC stack - for a value, refer to the `VPCID` in the "VPCStack"'s `Outputs` tab in the AWS CloudFormation view (e.g., vpc-0343606e). This VPC must exist with the proper configuration for Solace cluster access. |
| Use private subnets (UsePrivateSubnets) | true | Whether to use Private Subnets for the deployment |
| Public Subnet IDs (PublicSubnetIDs) | _Requires_ _input_ | If *not* using private subnets, provide a comma-separated list of public subnet IDs in your existing VPC (e.g., subnet-4b8d329f,subnet-bd73afc8,subnet-a01106c2), matching your deployment architecture. Note: this param will be ignored if you set the Use private subnets parameter to *true*. |
| Private Subnet IDs (PrivateSubnetIDs) | _Requires_ _input_ | If using private subnets, provide a comma-separated list of private subnet IDs in your existing VPC (e.g., subnet-4b8d329f,subnet-bd73afc8,subnet-a01106c2), matching your deployment architecture. Note: this param will be ignored if you set the Use private subnets parameter to *false*.  |
| Service exposure (ServiceExposureType) | internet-facing | Defines if the message router services are publicly exposed or only accessible internally from the VPC. |
| Security group allowed to access console SSH (SSHSecurityGroupID) | _Requires_ _input_ | The ID of the security group in your existing VPC that is allowed to access the console via SSH  - for a value, refer to the `BastionSecurityGroupID` in the "BastionStack"'s `Outputs` tab in the AWS CloudFormation view (e.g., sg-7f16e910). Note: leave it empty or it will be ignored if you set the Use private subnets parameter to *false*. |
| Services Access CIDR (ServicesAccessCIDR) | _Requires_ _input_ | The CIDR IP range that is permitted to access the message broker services - specify even if using private addresses. |

<br/><br/>

Select [next] after completing the parameters form to get to the "Options" screen.

Select [next] on the "Options" screen unless you want to add tags, use specific IAM roles, or blend in custom stacks.

Acknowledge that resources will be created and select [Create] in bottom right corner.

![alt text](/images/capabilities.png "Create Stack")

# Stack structure

The Quick Start will create the nested VPC, Bastion, and Solace stacks using their respective templates. The SolaceStack further creates sub-stacks for the deployment of the primary, backup and monitor message brokers. You’ll see all these listed in the AWS CloudFormation console, as illustrated below. Following the links in the Resources tab provides detailed information about the underlying resources.
 
![alt text](/images/stacks-after-deploy-success.png "Created stacks after deployment")

For external access to the deployment (explained in the next sections), the resources of interest are the
*	the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), and
*	the EC2 instances for the primary, backup, and monitoring message brokers.

For messaging and management access to the active message broker, you will need to note the information about the ELB’s DNS host name, which can be obtained from the `SolaceStack > Resources > ELB, or the EC2 Dashboard > Load Balancing > Load Balancers` section:
 
![alt text](/images/elb-details.png "ELB details")

For direct SSH access to the individual message brokers, the public DNS host names (elastic IPs) of the EC2 instances of the Bastion Hosts and the private DNS host names of the primary, backup, and monitoring message brokers are required. This can be obtained from the `EC2 Dashboard > Instances > Instances` section: 
 
![alt text](/images/ec2-instance-details.png "EC2 instances details")


# Gaining admin access to the message broker

## Using SSH connection to the individual message brokers

For persons used to working with Solace PubSub+ message broker console access, this is still available with the AWS EC2 instance:

* Copy the Key Pair file used during deployment (KeyPairName) to the Linux Bastion Host. The key must not be publicly viewable.
```
chmod 400 <key.pem>
scp -i <key.pem> <key.pem> ec2-user@<bastion-elastic-ip>:/home/ec2-user
```
* Log in to the Linux Bastion Host
```
ssh -i <key.pem> ec2-user@<bastion-elastic-ip>
```
* From the Linux Bastion Host, SSH to your desired EC2 host that is running the message broker.
```
ssh -i <key.pem> ec2-user@<ec2-host>
```
* From the host, log into the Solace CLI
```
sudo docker exec -it solace /usr/sw/loads/currentload/bin/cli -A
```

## Management tools access through the ELB

Non-CLI [management tools](https://docs.solace.com/Management-Tools.htm ) can access the message broker cluster through the ELB’s public DNS host name at port 8080. Use the user `admin` and the password you set for the "AdminPassword".

# Message Broker Logs

Both host and container logs get logged to [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/ ) on the region where the deployment occurred. The message broker logs can be found under the `*/solace.log` log stream. The `ContainerLoggingFormat` field can be used to control the log output format.

# About Quick Starts

Quick Starts are automated reference deployments for key workloads on the AWS Cloud. Each Quick Start launches, configures, and runs the AWS compute, network, storage, and other services required to deploy a specific workload on AWS using AWS best practices for security and availability.

# Testing data access to the HA cluster

To test data traffic though the newly created message broker instances, visit the Solace developer portal and select your preferred API or protocol to [send and receive messages](http://dev.solace.com/get-started/send-receive-messages/). Under each language there is a Publish/Subscribe tutorial that will help you get started.

For data, the message broker cluster can be accessed through the ELB’s public DNS host name and the API or protocol specific port.
